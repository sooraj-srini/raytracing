# Introduction

This is a implementation of a ray tracer, inspired by the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). This is still a work in progress.

# Dependencies
Instead of implementing a vec3, I used Vector3 from the `geometric` crate.

# Things left to do:
-[ ] Anti-aliasing
-[ ] Different materials for the spheres
-[ ] Different positions for the camera
